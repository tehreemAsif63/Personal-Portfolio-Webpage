        HTML Project Idea: Personal Portfolio Webpage (v1)
        💡 Idea:
        Create a static webpage about yourself — like a digital resume. It will showcase who you are, your skills, and
        goals.

        🔧 Features:
        Your name, picture, and a short intro

        A section about your education

        A section with your current skills (Python, HTML)

        A list of your goals (e.g., “Become a full-stack dev”)

        A contact form (just HTML for now, no backend)
